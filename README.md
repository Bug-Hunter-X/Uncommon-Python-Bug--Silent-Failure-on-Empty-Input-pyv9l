This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function correctly handles empty input lists by returning 0, which might not be the expected or most informative behavior.  This example highlights the importance of considering edge cases and potentially raising exceptions instead of returning a default value that could be misinterpreted. A more robust solution is provided in `bugSolution.py`.
